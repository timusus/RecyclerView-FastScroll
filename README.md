A simple `FastScroller` for Android's `RecyclerView`.

Supports vertical `RecyclerViews` using either `LinearLayoutManager` or `GridLayoutManager` (including multiple spans).

The style is loosely based on the `ListView` `FastScroller` from whatever the last version of Lollipop was. This library borrows heavily from [Google's Launcher3 FastScroller](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Launcher3/)

### Gradle
`compile 'com.simplecityapps:recyclerview-fastscroll:1.0.17'`

### Usage
You must use `FastScrollRecyclerView` as your base `RecyclerView`. See the sample project if you're having trouble.

Via xml:

     <com.simplecityapps.recyclerview_fastscroll.views.FastScrollRecyclerView
             android:id="@+id/recycler"
             android:layout_width="match_parent"
             android:layout_height="match_parent"
             app:fastScrollPopupBgColor="@color/colorAccent"
             app:fastScrollPopupTextColor="@android:color/primary_text_dark"
             app:fastScrollThumbColor="@color/colorAccent" />

To display the `FastScrollPopup`, your adapter must implement `FastScrollRecyclerView.SectionedAdapter` and override `getSectionName()`.

Example for FastScrollRecyclerView displaying String items:

```java
public static class RecyclerViewAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerViewAdapter.ViewHolder>
    implements FastScrollRecyclerView.SectionedAdapter {

  private final List<String> mObjects;

  public RecyclerViewAdapter(List<String> objects) {
    mObjects = objects;
  }
  
  ...

  @NonNull
  @Override
  public String getSectionName(int position) {
    //show the first item character for example
    return mObjects.get(position).substring(0, 1).toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault());
  }
}
```

If you need to know when fast-scrolling starts or stops, you can attach an OnFastScrollStateChangedListener to the FastScrollRecyclerView.

##### Varying Row Heights

By default, `FastScrollRecyclerView` assumes that all items in the adapter have the same height. If your adapter has
item views with different heights, then you should make your adapter implement the `MeasurableAdapter` interface and
override `getViewTypeHeight()` â€“ otherwise the scroll thumb may not appear in the correct position and scrolling may
be inconsistent.

`getViewTypeHeight()` returns the height of a single view of a given type in pixels. The height of each view must be
fixed and constant between all instances of a view type. Because the implementor is responsible for computing this
value before views are laid out, this is not suitable for view types where the height of a view is determined by a
variable number of lines of text that the item consumes.

Currently, `MeasurableAdapter` only works with `LinearLayoutManager`. Using `MeasurableAdapter` with a 
`GridLayoutManager` that has more than one span will cause the scrollbar thumb to reach the bottom of the list before
the halfway point on the scrollbar's background.

##### Customisation

You can enable/disable autohide using the `fastScrollAutoHide` & `fastScrollAutoHideDelay` attributes in xml:

     <com.simplecityapps.recyclerview_fastscroll.views.FastScrollRecyclerView
             app:fastScrollAutoHide="true"
             app:fastScrollAutoHideDelay="1500"
             ...
             
Or programmatically via `setAutoHideDelay(int hideDelay)` and `setAutoHideEnabled(boolean autoHideEnabled)`

The popup background, popup text, popupbackground size, popup text size, track background, thumb color and popup position can all be styled via xml:

      <com.simplecityapps.recyclerview_fastscroll.views.FastScrollRecyclerView
                  app:fastScrollPopupBgColor="@color/colorAccent"
                  app:fastScrollPopupTextColor="@android:color/primary_text_dark"
                  app:fastScrollPopupTextSize="56sp"
                  app:fastScrollPopupBackgroundSize="88dp"
                  app:fastScrollThumbColor="@color/colorAccent"
                  app:fastScrollTrackColor="#1f000000" 
                  app:fastScrollPopupPosition="adjacent"/>
                  ...
Or programmatically via `setThumbColor(@ColorInt int color)`, `setTrackColor(@ColorInt int color)`, `setPopupBgColor(@ColorInt int color)`, `setPopupTextColor(@ColorInt int color)`, `setPopupTextSize(int size)` & `setPopupPosition(@FastScroller.FastScrollerPopupPosition int position)`

You can enable/disable fast-scrolling via:


      <com.simplecityapps.recyclerview_fastscroll.views.FastScrollRecyclerView
                  app:fastScrollThumbEnabled="false"
                  ...
Or programmatically via `setFastScrollThumbEnabled(boolean enabled)`

### Updates

- Updated dependencies

1.0.14

- Make it possible to set popup position programmatically

1.0.13

- Added option to position the FastScroll-Popup in the center of the RecyclerView (rather than tracking adjacent to the FastScroll thumb)

1.0.12

- Fixed a Proguard Obfuscation issue preventing animations from running
- Fixed an issue where popup background color ignored alpha channel

- Fixed crash when no adapter was set on the `RecyclerView`
- Fixed crash when `RecyclerView` children are null (`itemCount` is non zero, but `getChildAt(0)` returns null).

v1.0.6
- The `FastScrollPopup` no longer requires your adapter to implement `SectionIndexer`, but rather `FastScrollRecyclerView.SectionedAdapter`, which is much easier to use.
